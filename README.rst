ArduinoRGBbuzzer.ino: 

This is code to use to flash Arduino 101 so it can change to a color and buzz a musical pitch when sending a switchCharacteristic.value() from your phone to Curie BLE, using Evothings for example. Please check the Evothings code below for making a phone app.

Arduino101RGB:

This folder contains everything needed to set up an Evothings app to turn LEDs to different colors and buzz a musical note. Code is in file index.html . Flash the Arduino 101 with ArduinoRGBbuzzer.ino above.
